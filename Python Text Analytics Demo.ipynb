    "One variation on N-grams are **skipgrams**. Skipgrams are similar to N-grams in that you are looking for items in your text that are of the same number of words (i.e. for bigrams, all items were two word pairs). However, the key difference is that you are allowed to \"skip\" words that appear in between. Skipgrams gets all N-word combinations of a review given the allowed number of words you can skip. Note that for skipgrams you need at least a two-gram (because there are no words between a single word!). Here is an example to better illustrate what skipgrams does.   "
